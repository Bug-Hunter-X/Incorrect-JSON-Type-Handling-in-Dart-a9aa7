This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart when handling JSON responses from APIs. The code fetches data from an API and processes it, but it fails if the JSON response is not of the expected type. The bug occurs because the code assumes the response is a JSON array (`List<dynamic>`), but it might be a JSON object (`Map<String, dynamic>`) or another type. This error leads to a runtime exception. The solution provides a more robust way of handling different JSON types, preventing unexpected exceptions.
